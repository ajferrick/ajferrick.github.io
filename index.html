        <p>Hi! I'm AJ Ferrick. ðŸ‘‹</p>
        <p>I work as a software engineer. I specialize in backend systems and web APIs,
            creating products through rapid prototyping and iterative refinement.
            I do my best work with focused teams of friendly people chasing ambitious ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
            I currently work at <a href="https://mytra.ai/">Mytra</a> writing software to control
            robots in a novel, high density warehouse storage system.
            I've previously worked at startups like Slack, Circa News, and Addepar.
