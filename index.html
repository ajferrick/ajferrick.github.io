        <p>Hi! I'm AJ Ferrick. ðŸ‘‹</p>
        <p>I work as a software engineer. I specialize in backend systems and web APIs,
            creating products through rapid prototyping and iterative refinement.
            I do my best work with focused teams of friendly people chasing ambitious ideas.
            I've previously worked at startups including Slack, Circa News, and Addepar.
